# Simple-HTTP-Server

This is an HTTP server implemented in Java. It supports HTTP GET, HEAD and DELETE requests from multiple clients through threading, and responses appropriately to connecting clients using the 200 OK, 204 No Content, 404 Not Found and 501 Not Implemented codes. It also supports text files such as text/html and binary images such as `images/jpg`, `images/jpeg`, `images/png` and `images/gif`. The server logs every request to a .txt file.

### Server

Run the server:

            cd src/
            java WebServerMain <document_root> <port_number> <max_number_of_active_threads>

where:

* document_root is the root directory from which the server will serve documents.
* port_number is the port on which the server will listen.
* <max_number_of_active_threads> is the maximum number of clients that can connect simultaneously to the server.

Example: `java WebServerMain ../www 12345 100`

A testing web root directory with html and binary image files is provided in the www directory.

    Terminal

            headers: curl -s -I -X GET localhost:12345/index.html
